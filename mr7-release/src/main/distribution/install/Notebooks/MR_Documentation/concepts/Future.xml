    <annotationProperty>MindRaider is in fact foundation of an ambitious project called e-mentality...

e-mentality is my spare time project since my college studies (late 90's). At the beginning there were just vague ideas. Since that time I had written tons of analyses and I created multiple prototypes. Lately I determined that I finally know how e-mentality should look like :-) - how it fits SW and its ontologies, annotations, inference engines and agents... so I decided to release an alpha of its building block - MindRaider.

Note that MindRaider is just the first step on the long way towards the full featured Semantic Web user agent (as I see it). Check MR blog for Vodyanoi (which should be MindRaider successor) and various thoughts on outliner/mind mapping topic.
