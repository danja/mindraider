# MindRaider
This is a new repository for further MindRaider (http://mindraider.sf.net) project 
development. The main reason for the move of susteinance development repository from 
SF to GitHub is (time) efficiency and productivity (code base, issues, release).

*Major* releases (tags and distribution) to be still released via SF, development
and fix/minor releases to be done on GitHub.
