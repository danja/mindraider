A useful metaphor for GROW is a map: once you know where you are going (the goal) and where you are (current reality), you can explore possible ways of making the journey (options) and choose the best.

Sequence:
   1 G oal
   2 R eality
   3 O ptions
   4 W ill (When, What, How)

The useage of GROW is not linear, it is iterative process.
